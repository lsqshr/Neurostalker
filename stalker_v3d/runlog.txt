Welcome to NeuroStalker!!
The current input file has the suffix [v3draw]
The data does not have supported image file suffix, -- now this program assumes it is Vaa3D's RAW format and tries to load it... 

size of [V3DLONG]=[8], [V3DLONG]=[8] [int]=[4], [short int]=[2], [double]=[8], [float]=[4]
The data endian code is [L]
The machine endian code is [L]
machine endian=[L] data endian=[L] b_swap=0

Just read 1157760 units, each unit has the size = 1
Finish reading 100% 
No swapping of data.

=============== Cropping the image ===============
1. Find the bounding box and crop image. 
boundingbox x dimension: 144,y dimension: 120,z dimension: 67.

The current input file has the surfix [v3draw]
The data is not with a known Vaa3D format, -- now this program assumes it is a Vaa3D RAW format.
