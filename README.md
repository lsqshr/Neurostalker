# Neurostalker

*WIP

A new experimental project initiated in BigNeuron 15 (http://alleninstitute.org/bigneuron/about/). 

A learning-based neuron tracing algorithm. The full source of code is hosted at github: https://github.com/lsqshr/Neurostalker.git

The files under matlab folder are scripts for experimenting algorithms. The c++ files are the implementation of this algorithm as a neuron-tracing plugin in Vaa3D (http://home.penglab.com/proj/vaa3d/home/index.html). Both are under intense development. Worth expecting!
